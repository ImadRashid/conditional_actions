## CI/CD
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Delivery).

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves continuously integrating code changes into a shared repository and automatically building and testing the changes as soon as they are pushed. This helps to identify and fix issues early on in the development process, leading to better quality code and a more efficient development workflow.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically deploying code changes to production as soon as they have passed all the required tests and checks. This means that changes can be released quickly and efficiently, reducing the time it takes to get new features and bug fixes into the hands of users.

Together, CI/CD is a powerful software development approach that enables development teams to rapidly and reliably deliver high-quality software to their users. By automating the build, test, and deployment process, developers can focus on writing code and delivering value to their users, while reducing the risk of human error and improving overall code quality.
## What are Github Actions
GitHub Actions is a feature of the GitHub platform that allows you to automate various tasks related to your software development workflows. GitHub Actions can be used to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions are composed of one or more tasks, each of which can be written in various programming languages or even in a shell script. These tasks can be combined into a workflow, which specifies the order in which they should be run, and when they should be triggered. Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, such as when code is pushed to the repository, when a pull request is opened or closed, or when a scheduled timer is triggered.

GitHub Actions can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, such as running unit tests, generating documentation, building and publishing packages, and deploying applications to production environments. Actions are defined using YAML files that are stored in your repository, making it easy to version control and collaborate on your workflows with your team.
